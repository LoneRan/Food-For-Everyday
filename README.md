# Food-For-Everyday

Every single day when we get up, we will face a philosophy question: what to eat today? what for breakfast, for lunch or dinner? What's more horrible is not only I'm very poor but also I'm too lazy to go out for vaggies or meats.

## Here is a story 
I only got 1000$ a month (sad story). Unfortunately I'm also a geek/fashion guy. I always think all the big impressive and great companies are assholes. Apple release new macbook pro 13 and I want it. Burberry's new arrivals are stunning and I want it. Well look at my pay bill and salary, fine nevermind. I can do these things: not travelling, not buying video games, not going out for dinner. But in the end, I have to eat. What if I can spend less on food, maybe I can save the money for what I want.

I have only **100$/200$/300$** or more a month. How can I survive? No. Not just survive! I want to eat healthy.

Basic idea: we can set up a database for most veggies and meats. Veggies and meats can be grouped together to be a dishes but some veggies and meats together can't be a dish. Clients can select what they like to eat. We can search the lowest price of all foods from Amazon fresh or whole foods or other web and make a combination of them based on their relationship to each other.

## Some restrict: 
--the whole prive can't exceed total budget. 
--the foods shouldn't be together can not form a conbination 
--should be healthy, which means vitamin or protein should be fulfilled (nobody want to die) 4)no diet
